Understand how EventPilot organizes the work that needs to be done so your event can run smoothly.

## How we set it up

EventPilot is built around the concept of **locations**, **jobs**, and **shifts**.

Shifts live inside of jobs, and jobs live inside of locations.

### Locations

Think of a location as an **independent time and space** where volunteers can work. You can have as many locations as you want, and they are a great way to communicate seperate units of work to your volunteers.

It is not uncommon to have **multiple locations that take place at the same physical location**, but may take place at different times. For example, if you are hosting a race of some sort, you might have a few packet pick-up pop-ups in the days leading up to the event. If you event is on Saturday, you might have packet pick-ups on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at a local coffee shop. Those are all at the same location, but it would make sense to have them as separate locations.

Locations can be as small and specific as you want. If you are hosting a marathon, you could have a single location for each individual water station if you wanted your volunteers to be able to pick what station they want to work, or you could have a single location and you manage the physical locations yourself.

If you have any questions regarding how to set up your event, please contact us at support@geteventpilot.com and we can talk you through it!

### Jobs

Think of a job as a **distinct task** that needs to be done. For example, if you are hosting a conference, you might have a job for ushers to help attendees find their seats, a job to help speakers get ready for their talk, and a job to help make sure the food table is stocked.

### Shifts

Think of a shift as a **time period** during which a volunteer is working on a job. Most events last longer than a volunteer would like to work, so it is helpful to allow volunteers to sign up for shorter periods of time.

## The philosophy behind EventPilot's organization

EventPilot is designed for medium- to large-scale events. These events commonly last several days, and span a large geographic area. We want to make it easy for you to manage volunteers across these dimensions, and we want to make it easy for your volunteers to do what they want to do, where they want to do it, and when they want to do it.
