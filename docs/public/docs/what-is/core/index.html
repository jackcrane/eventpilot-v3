In our eyes, the volunteer experience is one of the most important parts of any event.\nHow to set up for volunteers using EventPilot linkBefore you can start using EventPilot to recruit volunteers, you need to set up your event. This means setting up the locations, jobs, and shifts that your volunteers will work at, as well as building out the registration form so that you are gathering the information you need from your volunteers.\nLocations, Jobs, and Shifts linkThis means creating at least one location for your volunteers to work at, at least one job for your volunteers to spend their time at, and at least one shift for each job you created. Small events may just have one location, job and shift, but larger events will easily cross through 10s of locations and jobs and potentially hundreds of shifts. Registration Form linkBuilding out the registration form is the next step. EventPilot automatically collects the name and email of your volunteers, but it is up to you to decide what else you want to collect. Common things to collect include phone numbers, shirt sizes, “how you heard about us”, if they have volunteered with your event before, and more. The Volunteer Lifecycle linkEventPilot believes that the volunteer experience is one of the most important parts of any event. With EventPilot, the volunteer lifecycle is as easy as:\nRegistration linkYour volunteer uses an easy-to-use form made by EventPilot to register to volunteer for your event.\nConfirmation \u0026 Self-Service linkVolunteer receives an email with all their information and a link to a self-service dashboard where they can manage their registration.\n(This makes volunteers happier because they can change how and when they volunteer to better fit their schedule, and this makes event organizers happier because the volunteer can do this on their own, without having to bug you.)\nReminders linkVolunteer receives an email the week before the event with information about their shift and about the event. This serves as a reminder to volunteers and is an opportunity for event organizers to distribute information about the event.\nDay-of Reminders \u0026 last-minute updates linkVolunteer receives an email the day of the event with information about the event and their shift. This serves as a reference to volunteers and is an opportunity for event organizers to distribute last-minute information about the event.\nCritical event-day updates linkVolunteer receives critical updates sent by organizers during the event via email and SMS (this can include things like weather updates, last-minute changes to the event, and more).\nEvent-day dashboard linkVolunteer has access to a self-service event-day dashboard where they can access information about the event such as FAQ, the schedule, maps, and anything else shared by the organizers. This arms your volunteers with the information they need to feel involved and engaged, and gives them more information about the event that they can pass on to participants, helping your event run more smoothly.\nImmediate thank you linkVolunteer receives an immediate thank you email after they complete their shift.\nFeedback linkVolunteer receives an email after the event with a link to a feedback form where they can share their experience with the organizers.\nRe-Engagement \u0026 follow-up linkVolunteer receives an invitation to volunteer for your event next time it comes around!\n"

When a volunteer registers, they are automatically added to the CRM. When a participant registers, they are automatically added to the CRM. We don’t want to limit you to just using the CRM for people who have interacted with our platform, however, so we allow you to add any other contacts to the CRM. You can add a single contact at a time, or you can import unlimited contacts at once from a CSV file.\nWe wanted to build a powerful CRM that is easy to use and manage. You can add custom fields to your CRM table, allowing you to keep track of the information that matters to you. By default, we have a few fields that we require for contacts (like name), but beyond that, it is pretty much up to you!\nThe EventPilot CRM is also tightly integrated with the interactions that occur between your contacts and EventPilot. Anytime a contact interacts with EventPilot in any way, it will be automatically logged in the CRM. That means that you won’t have anything slip through the cracks.\n"

                content: "Understand how EventPilot organizes the work that needs to be done so your event can run smoothly.\nHow we set it up linkEventPilot is built around the concept of locations, jobs, and shifts.\nShifts live inside of jobs, and jobs live inside of locations.\nLocations linkThink of a location as an independent time and space where volunteers can work. You can have as many locations as you want, and they are a great way to communicate seperate units of work to your volunteers.\nIt is not uncommon to have multiple locations that take place at the same physical location, but may take place at different times. For example, if you are hosting a race of some sort, you might have a few packet pick-up pop-ups in the days leading up to the event. If you event is on Saturday, you might have packet pick-ups on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at a local coffee shop. Those are all at the same location, but it would make sense to have them as separate locations.\nLocations can be as small and specific as you want. If you are hosting a marathon, you could have a single location for each individual water station if you wanted your volunteers to be able to pick what station they want to work, or you could have a single location and you manage the physical locations yourself.\nIf you have any questions regarding how to set up your event, please contact us at support@geteventpilot.com and we can talk you through it!\nJobs linkThink of a job as a distinct task that needs to be done. For example, if you are hosting a conference, you might have a job for ushers to help attendees find their seats, a job to help speakers get ready for their talk, and a job to help make sure the food table is stocked.\nShifts linkThink of a shift as a time period during which a volunteer is working on a job. Most events last longer than a volunteer would like to work, so it is helpful to allow volunteers to sign up for shorter periods of time.\nThe philosophy behind EventPilot’s organization linkEventPilot is designed for medium- to large-scale events. These events commonly last several days, and span a large geographic area. We want to make it easy for you to manage volunteers across these dimensions, and we want to make it easy for your volunteers to do what they want to do, where they want to do it, and when they want to do it.\n"

                content: "We are constantly working on new features and improvements to EventPilot. Here is a list of what we are working on next.\nTight Email Integration linkEmails are a great opportunity for us to allow our customers to interact with their contacts. Whether that is an automated welcome or thanks for registering email, every email is a touch point and we want to make it easy for you to use EventPilot to tighten your relationships with your contacts.\nEmails are also a great source of data for the CRM, so we want to build a powerful email integration into EventPilot. This means being able to send emails to contacts right from the CRM, and being able to see when the email was delivered and opened right in the timeline with all the other interactions from that contact. We also want to build out an email marketing feature that allows you to send emails to your contacts based on the data living in the CRM.\nGiven all this data, we will be able to build a solid picture of your contacts, their interactions, and their interest in your event, allowing you to target your efforts more effectively.\nEventPilot for Teams linkEventPilot is a great tool for event organizers, but everyone knows everything is more fun with a friend! We want to make it easy for you to invite your team to EventPilot and use it to manage your event alongside your team. No longer will the entire burden land on the shoulders of the event organizer, but instead, you can give your volunteer coordinator the power to manage volunteers, hand the email marketing tools to your marketing/outreach person, and more.\nOrganizations linkWe want to make it easy for you to spin up new events and allow them to inherit the data from your existing events. Many organizations have many events through the year, so we want to give them the same tools present in EventPilot now, but scope them to an organization. This will involve moving the CRM and donations to the organization level.\nDonations linkWe know how important donations are to events and nonprofits, so we want to make it easy for you to accept donations through EventPilot. Centralizing your donations to being on EventPilot will provide you with a powerful tool to help understand the financial picture of your event and your donors.\nUsing the glut of data on your event gathered by EventPilot, you can build out an impactful fundraising campaign that will not only help raise the money for your event to succeed, but raise money for your nonprofit as well.\nParticipant Registration \u0026 Management linkYou can have a great event, but without participants, what is the point? We want to arm event organizers with modern, powerful, and easy-to-use tools to allow participants to register for your event. That means taking the work we have done to build the volunteer registration system and applying it to a participant registration system.\nThis also means integrating with a payments system so that participants can pay for their registration.\nCentralized Support \u0026 Contact Hub linkWe want to allow events to route their support requests to a centralized support hub. That will mean setting up a mailbox that directs to our servers, so that when someone sends an email to support@yourevent.com, it will be routed directly into your EventPilot account, where it gets affiliated and logged with a CRM record, and gives you the ability to respond to the request with all the context of that person’s previous interactions with your event.\nWe can also integrate with social media platforms, so when people send you direct messages, they can filter into the same system, meaning you only have to watch one inbox for all your interactions.\nSocial Media Integration linkGreat events are built on social media, so we want to make it easy for you to integrate your event with your social media accounts. We want to give you the ability to post to all your social media accounts from a single dashboard, manage responses and feedbacks, understand engagement, and see the impact of your social media efforts directly overlaid on your event’s timeline.\n"
