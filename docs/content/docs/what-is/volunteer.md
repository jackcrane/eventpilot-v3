Recruit, manage, track, check-in, follow-up, and re-engage with your volunteers. In our eyes, the volunteer experience is one of the most important parts of any event.

## How to set up for volunteers using EventPilot

Before you can start using EventPilot to recruit volunteers, you need to set up your event. This means setting up the locations, jobs, and shifts that your volunteers will work at, as well as building out the registration form so that you are gathering the information you need from your volunteers.

1. ### Locations, Jobs, and Shifts
   This means creating at least one location for your volunteers to work at, at least one job for your volunteers to spend their time at, and at least one shift for each job you created. Small events may just have one location, job and shift, but larger events will easily cross through 10s of locations and jobs and potentially hundreds of shifts.
2. ### Registration Form
   Building out the registration form is the next step. EventPilot automatically collects the name and email of your volunteers, but it is up to you to decide what else you want to collect. Common things to collect include phone numbers, shirt sizes, "how you heard about us", if they have volunteered with your event before, and more.

## The Volunteer Lifecycle

EventPilot believes that the volunteer experience is one of the most important parts of any event. With EventPilot, the volunteer lifecycle is as easy as:

1. ### Registration
   Your volunteer uses an easy-to-use form made by EventPilot to register to volunteer for your event.
2. ### Confirmation & Self-Service
   Volunteer receives an email with all their information and a link to a self-service dashboard where they can manage their registration.

    (*This makes volunteers happier because they can change how and when they volunteer to better fit their schedule, and this makes event organizers happier because the volunteer can do this on their own, without having to bug you.*)

3. ### Reminders
   Volunteer receives an email the week before the event with information about their shift and about the event. This serves as a reminder to volunteers and is an opportunity for event organizers to distribute information about the event.
4. ### Day-of Reminders & last-minute updates
   Volunteer receives an email the day of the event with information about the event and their shift. This serves as a reference to volunteers and is an opportunity for event organizers to distribute last-minute information about the event.
5. ### Critical event-day updates
   Volunteer receives critical updates sent by organizers during the event via email and SMS (this can include things like weather updates, last-minute changes to the event, and more).
6. ### Event-day dashboard
   Volunteer has access to a self-service event-day dashboard where they can access information about the event such as FAQ, the schedule, maps, and anything else shared by the organizers. This arms your volunteers with the information they need to feel involved and engaged, and gives them more information about the event that they can pass on to participants, helping your event run more smoothly.
7. ### Immediate thank you
   Volunteer receives an immediate thank you email after they complete their shift.
8. ### Feedback
   Volunteer receives an email after the event with a link to a feedback form where they can share their experience with the organizers.
9. ### Re-Engagement & follow-up
    Volunteer receives an invitation to volunteer for your event next time it comes around!
