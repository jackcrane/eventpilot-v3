EventPilot is a powerful tool, and we have strived to make it easy to use, but a little guidance is always helpful. This page will cover your first steps into EventPilot, getting you up and running with the basics.

## 1. Create an EventPilot Account

To get started, you'll need to create an account. You will do this by clicking any of the "register" buttons or by visiting [geteventpilot.com/register](https://geteventpilot.com/register). We will need your name, your email address, and a password to create your accout. Be sure to use an email address you have access to, as you will need to verify your email address to access your account.

Once you verify your email, you will be taken to the events page ([geteventpilot.com/events](https://geteventpilot.com/events)), where, once you have created an event, you will see a list of your events.

You will see a list of "What to do next?" items. You will see this box a few places throughout EventPilot, and it is a great way to keep track of what you need to do next. If you feel like you are ready to go it alone, you can follow the "What to do next?" items and get started. Otherwise, keep following this page to get up and running.

## 2. Create an Event

Creating an [event](/docs/vocab/#event) is the first step in using EventPilot. It will hold all of your data for a particular event.

Create an event by clicking the "Create Event" button on the page you are directed to after registering ([geteventpilot.com/events](https://geteventpilot.com/events)). You will need to enter:

{{< table "table-responsive" >}}
| Field | Description | Restrictions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | The name of your event | Must be at least 2 characters long | "The Atlantis Marathon" |
| Description | A short description of your event | Must be at least 10 characters long | "Run 26.2 miles through the lost city of Atlantis" |
| Slug | A short, lowercase, hyphenated string of letters | Must be 3-30 characters long and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens | "atlantis-marathon" |
| Logo | Your event's logo | Should be a square image at least 200px by 200px | *n/a* |
| Default Timezone | The timezone in which your event will be hosted | *n/a* | "Eastern Standard Time" |
{{< /table >}}

All fields are required, but can be changed later.

{{< alert context="warning" text="We strongly recommend <b>not</b> changing the slug after you have created your event. URLs autogenerated by EventPilot will use the event's slug, so changing the slug will break links to your event (including ones that EventPilot has generated and sent to your contacts)." />}}

## 3. The event dashboard

Once you have created your event, you will be taken to the event dashboard.

<img src="/images/bps/event-dashboard.png" alt="Event dashboard" style="width: 100%;" />

This is your main headquarters for your event. As more starts to happen in your event, you will see analytics and prompts here to help you keep track of what is happening. For now though, lets take a tour to get you familiar with the dashboard.

### 3.1 Take a tour

Many pages in EventPilot have a tour that can help you get familiar with the page. If a tour is available, you will see a red "Help!" button at the bottom left of the page. Clicking this button will launch the tour.

Go take the tour and come back to this page when you are done.

The tour highlighted a few main sections of the page:

1. The **top navigation** is the main navigation for your event. It is where you can visit different pages of your event.
2. The **event picker** is where you can quickly jump to a different event or create a new one.
3. The **"Help!** button is where you can launch the tour for the page.
4. The **Todo List** is where you can quickly see what needs to be done next.

The todo list is what this page is built on. You can follow it yourself, or you can keep this page as a reference so we can explain what is happening and what is happening next.

## 4. Volunteer Registration Form

Looking at the todo list, you will see that there is an item called "Volunteer Registration Form Not Started", with a button that will take you to the registration builder.

<img src="/images/bps/registration-builder.png" alt="Registration builder" style="width: 100%;" />

Looking in the bottom left corner of the page, you can see that a tour is available. Take the tour and come back to this page when you are done.

Now that you have taken the tour, you have an idea of what the registration builder is and how it works. We are going to add a phone number and favorite color field to the registration form.

If you have specific questions or want more information about a section in the registration builder, visit the link below for the documentation for the Registration Builder.

<a href="/docs/pages/registration-builder/" target="_blank">

{{< alert icon="ðŸ”—" context="primary" text="Click here to go to the documentation for the Registration Builder" />}}

</a>

### 4.1 Add a phone number field

On the left side of the registration builder, drag a "Phone" field from the field palette to the canvas. That means click on the "Phone" field in the field palette, and (while holding the mouse down) move it into the dashed area in the canvas. The order of the fields in the canvas will determine the order in which they are displayed on the form, so if you want to change the order, just drag the fields around.

Set the **Label** to "Your Phone Number", and the **Placeholder* to "555-555-5555". Take a look at the preview to see what the field will look like. If you want to add anything else (context, how you will use the phone number, etc.), you can do that in the description.

Lets set it to **Required** by clicking on the switch next to the label. Now, when you look in the preview, you will see that the field now has a red asterisk next to it.

### 4.2 Add a favorite color field

On the left side of the registration builder, drag a "Dropdown" field from the field palette to the canvas. Again, lets set the **Label** to "Your Favorite Color", and the **Placeholder* to "Pick a color". Take a look at the preview to see what the field will look like.

In the preview, click the dropdown button to find that there are no options. That is because we haven't added any options yet.

Under the required switch, click on "Add Option" to add an option, and add "Red" to the dropdown. Now, click "Add Option" again and add "Blue" to the dropdown. You can add as many options as you want. If you add too many or want to remove an option, just click the trash icon next to the option.

Now, when you try it out in the preview, you will see that the dropdown menu has the options you added.

### 4.3 Save the form

When you are done, click the save button under the canvas to save your form.

{{< alert context="warning" text="Your changes are not saved until you click the save button. Once you click the save button, your changes take effect immediately and you will not be able to go back to a previous version of the form." />}}

### What now?

Now, you have set up a registration form with a phone number and favorite color field. You can always go back and add more fields or modify or remove existing fields, but we are done for now. Click the "Event Home" button at the top of the page to go back to the event dashboard.

## 5. Create a location

Back on the event homepage, check out the Todo list. You will see that "Volunteer Registration Form Not Started" has turned green, been marked as done, and moved to the bottom of the list. Looking at what needs to be done next, we see "First Location Not Created". This means we need to create a [location](/docs/what-is/locations+jobs+shifts/#locations).

To do this, we need to go to the "Jobs & Shift Builder" page. You can do this by clicking on the "Jobs & Shifts Builder" button in the navigation bar under your event name, or by clicking the "Go to the Jobs & Shifts Builder" button in the todo item.

<img src="/images/bps/jobs-and-shifts-builder.png" alt="Jobs & Shifts Builder" style="width:100%"/>

As always, we recommend you take the tour. The tour on this page is very comprehensive and will discuss the entire process. That said, we will go through the steps here.

### 5.1 Create a location

Click the "Create a Location" button under the description of the page. This will open the "Create a new Location" popup. This will ask you to enter some basic information about the location:

{{< table "table-responsive" >}}
| Field | Required | Description | Restrictions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Yes | The name of your location | Must be at least 2 characters long | "Finish Line", "Packet Pick-Up" |
| Description | Yes | A short description of your location | Must be at least 10 characters long | "Help us keep the finish line running" |
| Address | No | The address of your location |  | "1234 Main St, Apt. 123, San Francisco, CA 94102" |
| City | No | The city of your location |  | "San Francisco" |
| State | No | The state of your location |  | "California" |
| Start Time and Date | Yes | The start time and date of your location |  |  |
| End Time and Date* | Yes | The end time and date of your location |  |  |
{{< /table >}}

*\* There is a button "Copy from Start Time" right next to the label for the end time. Clicking this will copy the start time to the end time. You will still have to change the end time, but this can save you some time!*

Once you have entered all the information, click the "Create Location" button.

<img src="/images/bps/jobs-and-shifts-builder-location.png" alt="The builder with a location" style="width:100%"/>

### 5.2 Create a job

Now that we have a location, we can create a job. Click the "Create Job" button on the right side of the page. This will open the "Create a new Job" popup. This will ask you to enter some basic information about the job:

{{< table "table-responsive" >}}
| Field | Required | Description | Restrictions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Location | Yes | The location that this job is for |  | (this will default to the location you just created) |
| Job Name | Yes | The name of your job | Must be at least 2 characters long | "Finish Line", "Packet Pick-Up" |
| Description | No | A short description of your job |  | "Help us keep the finish line running" |
| Maximum Volunteers | No | The maximum number of volunteers that can be registered for this job. If you set this to 0, it will be unlimited. |  | 10 |
| Restrictions | No | Any restrictions that apply to this job |  | "Must be over 21" |
{{< /table >}}

Once you have entered all the information for the job, we need to create some shifts.

### 5.3 Create shifts

From inside the job popup, click the "Create a shift" button. This will ask you for some information about the shift:

{{< table "table-responsive" >}}
| Field | Required | Description | Restrictions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capacity | No | The maximum number of volunteers that can be registered for this shift. If you set this to 0, it will be unlimited. By default, this will inherit from the job. |  | 10 |
| Start Time and Date | Yes | The start time and date of the shift. If this is the first shift, this will default to the start time of your location. If it is not the first shift, it will default to the end time of the previous shift. |  |  |
| End Time and Date | Yes | The end time and date of the shift.
{{< /table >}}

*Just like the location, you can copy the start time and date to the end time and date.*

Once you have entered all the information, the shift builder will show you the approximate length of the shift. Give this a quick gut-check to make sure it is correct. If it is not, check the start and end times and make sure they are correct. Once you are satisfied, you can click the "Create another shift" button to create more shifts. They will automatically infer the length of the previous shift, so if you are just creating several 2 hour shifts, you won't have to enter the start and end times for each one.

Once you are finished, click the "Create Job" button at the bottom of the popup to save your job.

#### 5.3.1 Job Interfaces

Note that there are 2 interfaces for viewing jobs and shifts. You can switch between them by clicking the "View as Calendar" or "View as Table" button in the "Actions" dropdown pictured in the screenshots.

##### 5.3.1.1 The Job Calendar

The job calendar is the default interface for viewing jobs and shows the most data.

<img src="/images/bps/jobs-and-shifts-builder-job-calendar.png" alt="The builder with a job" style="width:100%"/>

##### 5.3.1.1 The Job Table

The job table is a more explicit interface for viewing jobs and shifts.

# 6. Getting in good payment standing

If you go back to the event home, you will see that lots of todo items are marked as done. All that is left is to get in good payment standing by setting up a payment method. You will see a red banner across the top of the page with a link to set up a payment method, or you can click the "Set up a payment method" button in the todo list.

# 7. Finishing up

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first event and are ready to go live. You have a basic understanding of how EventPilot works and how to interact with its interface. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please reach out to us at support@geteventpilot.com.
