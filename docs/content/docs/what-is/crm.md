Keep track of your contacts and manage relationships with volunteers, participants, sponsors, and any other contact.

## Why the EventPilot CRM is powerful

EventPilot's CRM is a powerful tool that is **built-in** to other EventPilot features. When a volunteer registers, they are automatically added to the CRM. When a participant registers, they are automatically added to the CRM. We don't want to limit you to just using the CRM for people who have interacted with our platform, however, so we allow you to add any other contacts to the CRM. You can add a single contact at a time, or you can import unlimited contacts at once from a CSV file.

We wanted to build a powerful CRM that is easy to use and manage. You can add custom fields to your CRM table, allowing you to keep track of the information that **matters to you**. By default, we have a few fields that we require for contacts (like name), but beyond that, it is pretty much up to you!

The EventPilot CRM is also tightly integrated with the interactions that occur between your contacts and EventPilot. Anytime a contact interacts with EventPilot in any way, it will be automatically logged in the CRM. That means that you won't have anything slip through the cracks.
