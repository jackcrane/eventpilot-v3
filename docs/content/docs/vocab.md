EventPilot uses a number of terms where clarity is important. Here is a glossary of terms used in EventPilot.

## Event

An event is a collection of locations, jobs, shifts, volunteers, statistics, and contacts. It is the "highest level" form of organization in EventPilot. We recommend creating a distinct EventPilot event for each event you are running. You can create as many events as you want.
