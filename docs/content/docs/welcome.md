Welcome to EventPilot! We are excited to have you here and are ready to help you get the most out of EventPilot. We are continuously improving EventPilot and want to make it the most powerful and intuitive tool for event organizers.

## About EventPilot

EventPilot was born out of an event called [Ohio River Paddlefest](https://ohioriverpaddlefest.org) and a desire to make it easier to manage volunteers for a medium-sized event. From there, it has grown into a powerful tool to allow event organizers to host their events, keep track of what needs to be done, recruit and manage volunteers, manage relationships, and more. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions anytime, please reach out to us at [support@geteventpilot.com](mailto:support@geteventpilot.com).

## Our Core Goals

1. Arm events management teams with never-before-accessible tools to manage, grow, and *understand* their events.
2. Keep our software down-to-earth and easy to use and understand.
3. Anytime there is complexity, thoroughly document it and make it easier to understand.
4. Provide a great user experience for event organizers, volunteers, participants, and anyone else who uses EventPilot.
