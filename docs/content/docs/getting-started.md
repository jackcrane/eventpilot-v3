EventPilot is a powerful tool, and we have strived to make it easy to use, but a little guidance is always helpful. This page will cover your first steps into EventPilot, getting you up and running with the basics.

## 1. Create an EventPilot Account

To get started, you'll need to create an account. You will do this by clicking any of the "register" buttons or by visiting [geteventpilot.com/register](https://geteventpilot.com/register). We will need your name, your email address, and a password to create your accout. Be sure to use an email address you have access to, as you will need to verify your email address to access your account.

## 2. Create an Event

Creating an [event](/docs/vocab/#event) is the first step in using EventPilot. It will hold all of your data for a particular event.

Create an event by clicking the "Create Event" button on the page you are directed to after registering ([geteventpilot.com/events](https://geteventpilot.com/events)). You will need to enter:

{{< table "table-responsive" >}}
| Field | Description | Restrictions | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | The name of your event | Must be at least 2 characters long | "The Atlantis Marathon" |
| Description | A short description of your event | Must be at least 10 characters long | "Run 26.2 miles through the lost city of Atlantis" |
| Slug | A short, lowercase, hyphenated string of letters | Must be 3-30 characters long and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens | "atlantis-marathon" |
| Logo | Your event's logo | Should be a square image at least 200px by 200px | *n/a* |
| Default Timezone | The timezone in which your event will be hosted | *n/a* | "Eastern Standard Time" |
{{< /table >}}

All fields are required, but can be changed later.

{{< alert context="warning" text="We strongly recommend <b>not</b> changing the slug after you have created your event. URLs autogenerated by EventPilot will use the event's slug, so changing the slug will break links to your event (including ones that EventPilot has generated and sent to your contacts)." />}}
