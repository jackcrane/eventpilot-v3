        <p>EventPilot uses a number of terms where clarity is important. Here is a glossary of terms used in EventPilot.</p>
<h2 id="event">Event <a href="#event" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="material-icons align-middle">link</i></a></h2><p>An event is a collection of locations, jobs, shifts, volunteers, statistics, and contacts. It is the &ldquo;highest level&rdquo; form of organization in EventPilot. We recommend creating a distinct EventPilot event for each event you are running. You can create as many events as you want.</p>

                description: "How to build a registration form for volunteers.",
                content: "The registration builder is a tool in EventPilot that allows you to customize what data you want to collect from your volunteers.\nBy default, EventPilot will collect your volunteers’ name and email address. You cannot customize this, but you can add additional fields.\nSections linkThe registration builder is divided into 3 primary sections. We recommend taking the tour (click the red “Help! button in the bottom left corner of the page) to get familiar with the UI.\n1. The Canvas linkThe canvas, highlighted in green in the image above, is a “preview” of what your registration form will collect and is where you can customize the bahavior and content of the fields.\n2. The Field Palette linkThe field palette, highlighted in red in the image above, hosts “primitive” fields that you can add to your registration form. These fields are the most basic building blocks of a registration form.\nField Type Description Example prompt Text A simple, single-line text input that accepts any text, but will strip line breaks. “What is your favorite color?” Email An email input that only accepts valid email addresses. Remember that EventPilot automatically collects the name and email of your volunteers. You can collect additional information, but EventPilot will use the automatic fields to identify your volunteers and send them emails. “What is your email address?” Phone A phone number input that accepts any phone number, including international prefixes, extensions, and other formats. “What is your phone number?” Short Answer A multi-line text input that accepts any text. Should be used for fields with longer responses or responses requiring multiple lines. “What is your address?” Boolean A switch that allows the user to select “Yes” or “No”. “Have you volunteered before?” Dropdown A dropdown menu that allows the user to select from a list of preset options and does not allow any custom text. “What is your favorite sport?” 3. The Template Palette linkThe template palette, highlighted in blue in the image above, hosts “template” fields that you can add to your registration form. These are just normal fields, but they are pre-populated with default values for common needs.\nField Type Description Example prompt T-Shirt Size A dropdown menu that allows the user to select from a list of t-shirt sizes ranging from XS to XXL “What is your t-shirt size?” Referral Source A dropdown menu that allows the user to select from a list of referral sources. “What is your referral source?” If, for example, you have an event with lots of kids volunteering and our preset t-shirt sizes are not enough, you can just drag the t-shirt size field from the template palette to the canvas and add your own options.\nCustomizing the fields linkAny good form builder needs to allow you to customize the fields that are in the canvas. Different fields have different options, but we will go over all of them here.\nLabel linkThe label is the text that will be displayed to the user above the input field. This should be a very short description of what this field is for. Examples could include “Your Name”, “Phone Number”, “Address”, “What is your favorite color?”, etc.\nPlaceholder linkThe placeholder is the text that will be displayed inside the input field when the user hasn’t entered anything. This is great for an example, like “555-555-5555” for a phone number, or “yellow” for a favorite color. This text will be greyed out, and once the user starts typing, the placeholder will disappear.\nDescription linkThe description is the text that will be displayed below the label. This can be a longer, multi-line description of what this field is for.\nRequired linkThis is a switch that determines whether the field is required or not. If a field is required, EventPilot will display a red asterisk next to the field to indicate that it is required and will not allow the form to be submitted unless something is entered in the field.\nAutocomplete Type linkThis is a dropdown that allows you to select an autocomplete type. Setting an autocomplete type allows user’s browsers to suggest addresses, phone numbers, and other fields. This will make it easier for your users to fill out the form, and will allow EventPilot to better understand your data to give you better insights. Setting a type will not force your users to accept an autocomplete, it will just provide a suggestion.\nThis is optional and defaults to “Off”.\nClick to see a list of supported autocomplete types Autocomplete Type Description Example Off No autocomplete n/a First line of the street address First line of the street address 1234 Main St Second line of the street address Second line of the street address Apt. 123 First level of the address First level of the address, e.g. the county (less commonly used in the US) Hamilton Second level of the address Second level of the address, e.g. the city (less commonly used in the US) Cincinnati Third level of the address Third level of the address Fourth level of the address Fourth level of the address Street Address Full street address 1234 Main St, Apt. 123, San Francisco, CA 94102 Country Code Country code (ISO 3166) US Country Name Country name United States Postal Code Postal code 94102 Full Name Full name John Doe First Name First name John Middle Name Middle name Last Name Last name Doe Honorific Prefix Honorific prefix Mr., Mrs., Dr., etc. Honorific Suffix Honorific suffix Jr., Sr., III, esq, etc. Nickname Nickname Job Title Job title Birthday (full date) Full birthday 03/01/1980 Birthday (day) Birthday 1 Birthday (month) Birthday 3 Birthday (year) Birthday 1980 Gender Identity Gender identity freeform response Company Name Company name Language Language URL URL Email Email Phone Phone Country code for phone number The phone number’s country country code in ISO 3166 National phone number The phone number’s country prefix +1 (US) Area code for phone number The phone number’s area code 513 Local phone number The phone number’s local number 555-5555 Local phone number prefix The phone number’s local number prefix Local phone number suffix The phone number’s local number suffix Phone number extension The phone number’s extension x123 IM address IM address Prompt linkPresent only on Dropdown fields, this is the text that will be displayed in the button that opens the dropdown menu when there is no value selected. Should not be left blank, commonly values are “Select a value” or “Choose an option” but can be more specific to the field.\nOptions linkPresent only on Dropdown fields, this is a list of options that will be displayed in the dropdown menu.\n"

                description: "Your first steps into EventPilot.",
                content: "EventPilot is a powerful tool, and we have strived to make it easy to use, but a little guidance is always helpful. This page will cover your first steps into EventPilot, getting you up and running with the basics.\n1. Create an EventPilot Account linkTo get started, you’ll need to create an account. You will do this by clicking any of the “register” buttons or by visiting geteventpilot.com/register. We will need your name, your email address, and a password to create your accout. Be sure to use an email address you have access to, as you will need to verify your email address to access your account.\nOnce you verify your email, you will be taken to the events page (geteventpilot.com/events), where, once you have created an event, you will see a list of your events.\nYou will see a list of “What to do next?” items. You will see this box a few places throughout EventPilot, and it is a great way to keep track of what you need to do next. If you feel like you are ready to go it alone, you can follow the “What to do next?” items and get started. Otherwise, keep following this page to get up and running.\n2. Create an Event linkCreating an event is the first step in using EventPilot. It will hold all of your data for a particular event.\nCreate an event by clicking the “Create Event” button on the page you are directed to after registering (geteventpilot.com/events). You will need to enter:\nField Description Restrictions Example Name The name of your event Must be at least 2 characters long “The Atlantis Marathon” Description A short description of your event Must be at least 10 characters long “Run 26.2 miles through the lost city of Atlantis” Slug A short, lowercase, hyphenated string of letters Must be 3-30 characters long and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens “atlantis-marathon” Logo Your event’s logo Should be a square image at least 200px by 200px n/a Default Timezone The timezone in which your event will be hosted n/a “Eastern Standard Time” All fields are required, but can be changed later.\nwarning We strongly recommend not changing the slug after you have created your event. URLs autogenerated by EventPilot will use the event’s slug, so changing the slug will break links to your event (including ones that EventPilot has generated and sent to your contacts). 3. The event dashboard linkOnce you have created your event, you will be taken to the event dashboard.\nThis is your main headquarters for your event. As more starts to happen in your event, you will see analytics and prompts here to help you keep track of what is happening. For now though, lets take a tour to get you familiar with the dashboard.\n3.1 Take a tour linkMany pages in EventPilot have a tour that can help you get familiar with the page. If a tour is available, you will see a red “Help!” button at the bottom left of the page. Clicking this button will launch the tour.\nGo take the tour and come back to this page when you are done.\nThe tour highlighted a few main sections of the page:\nThe top navigation is the main navigation for your event. It is where you can visit different pages of your event. The event picker is where you can quickly jump to a different event or create a new one. The “Help! button is where you can launch the tour for the page. The Todo List is where you can quickly see what needs to be done next. The todo list is what this page is built on. You can follow it yourself, or you can keep this page as a reference so we can explain what is happening and what is happening next.\n4. Volunteer Registration Form linkLooking at the todo list, you will see that there is an item called “Volunteer Registration Form Not Started”, with a button that will take you to the registration builder.\nLooking in the bottom left corner of the page, you can see that a tour is available. Take the tour and come back to this page when you are done.\nNow that you have taken the tour, you have an idea of what the registration builder is and how it works. We are going to add a phone number and favorite color field to the registration form.\nIf you have specific questions or want more information about a section in the registration builder, visit the link below for the documentation for the Registration Builder.\n🔗 Click here to go to the documentation for the Registration Builder 4.1 Add a phone number field linkOn the left side of the registration builder, drag a “Phone” field from the field palette to the canvas. That means click on the “Phone” field in the field palette, and (while holding the mouse down) move it into the dashed area in the canvas. The order of the fields in the canvas will determine the order in which they are displayed on the form, so if you want to change the order, just drag the fields around.\nSet the Label to “Your Phone Number”, and the *Placeholder to “555-555-5555”. Take a look at the preview to see what the field will look like. If you want to add anything else (context, how you will use the phone number, etc.), you can do that in the description.\nLets set it to Required by clicking on the switch next to the label. Now, when you look in the preview, you will see that the field now has a red asterisk next to it.\n4.2 Add a favorite color field linkOn the left side of the registration builder, drag a “Dropdown” field from the field palette to the canvas. Again, lets set the Label to “Your Favorite Color”, and the *Placeholder to “Pick a color”. Take a look at the preview to see what the field will look like.\nIn the preview, click the dropdown button to find that there are no options. That is because we haven’t added any options yet.\nUnder the required switch, click on “Add Option” to add an option, and add “Red” to the dropdown. Now, click “Add Option” again and add “Blue” to the dropdown. You can add as many options as you want. If you add too many or want to remove an option, just click the trash icon next to the option.\nNow, when you try it out in the preview, you will see that the dropdown menu has the options you added.\n4.3 Save the form linkWhen you are done, click the save button under the canvas to save your form.\nwarning Your changes are not saved until you click the save button. Once you click the save button, your changes take effect immediately and you will not be able to go back to a previous version of the form. What now? linkNow, you have set up a registration form with a phone number and favorite color field. You can always go back and add more fields or modify or remove existing fields, but we are done for now. Click the “Event Home” button at the top of the page to go back to the event dashboard.\n5. Create a location linkBack on the event homepage, check out the Todo list. You will see that “Volunteer Registration Form Not Started” has turned green, been marked as done, and moved to the bottom of the list. Looking at what needs to be done next, we see “First Location Not Created”. This means we need to create a location.\nTo do this, we need to go to the “Jobs \u0026 Shift Builder” page. You can do this by clicking on the “Jobs \u0026 Shifts Builder” button in the navigation bar under your event name, or by clicking the “Go to the Jobs \u0026 Shifts Builder” button in the todo item.\nAs always, we recommend you take the tour. The tour on this page is very comprehensive and will discuss the entire process. That said, we will go through the steps here.\n5.1 Create a location linkClick the “Create a Location” button under the description of the page. This will open the “Create a new Location” popup. This will ask you to enter some basic information about the location:\nField Required Description Restrictions Example Name Yes The name of your location Must be at least 2 characters long “Finish Line”, “Packet Pick-Up” Description Yes A short description of your location Must be at least 10 characters long “Help us keep the finish line running” Address No The address of your location “1234 Main St, Apt. 123, San Francisco, CA 94102” City No The city of your location “San Francisco” State No The state of your location “California” Start Time and Date Yes The start time and date of your location End Time and Date* Yes The end time and date of your location * There is a button “Copy from Start Time” right next to the label for the end time. Clicking this will copy the start time to the end time. You will still have to change the end time, but this can save you some time!\nOnce you have entered all the information, click the “Create Location” button.\n5.2 Create a job linkNow that we have a location, we can create a job. Click the “Create Job” button on the right side of the page. This will open the “Create a new Job” popup. This will ask you to enter some basic information about the job:\nField Required Description Restrictions Example Location Yes The location that this job is for (this will default to the location you just created) Job Name Yes The name of your job Must be at least 2 characters long “Finish Line”, “Packet Pick-Up” Description No A short description of your job “Help us keep the finish line running” Maximum Volunteers No The maximum number of volunteers that can be registered for this job. If you set this to 0, it will be unlimited. 10 Restrictions No Any restrictions that apply to this job “Must be over 21” Once you have entered all the information for the job, we need to create some shifts.\n5.3 Create shifts linkFrom inside the job popup, click the “Create a shift” button. This will ask you for some information about the shift:\nField Required Description Restrictions Example Capacity No The maximum number of volunteers that can be registered for this shift. If you set this to 0, it will be unlimited. By default, this will inherit from the job. 10 Start Time and Date Yes The start time and date of the shift. If this is the first shift, this will default to the start time of your location. If it is not the first shift, it will default to the end time of the previous shift. End Time and Date Yes The end time and date of the shift. Just like the location, you can copy the start time and date to the end time and date.\nOnce you have entered all the information, the shift builder will show you the approximate length of the shift. Give this a quick gut-check to make sure it is correct. If it is not, check the start and end times and make sure they are correct. Once you are satisfied, you can click the “Create another shift” button to create more shifts. They will automatically infer the length of the previous shift, so if you are just creating several 2 hour shifts, you won’t have to enter the start and end times for each one.\nOnce you are finished, click the “Create Job” button at the bottom of the popup to save your job.\n5.3.1 Job Interfaces linkNote that there are 2 interfaces for viewing jobs and shifts. You can switch between them by clicking the “View as Calendar” or “View as Table” button in the “Actions” dropdown pictured in the screenshots.\n5.3.1.1 The Job Calendar linkThe job calendar is the default interface for viewing jobs and shows the most data.\n5.3.1.1 The Job Table linkThe job table is a more explicit interface for viewing jobs and shifts.\n6. Getting in good payment standing linkIf you go back to the event home, you will see that lots of todo items are marked as done. All that is left is to get in good payment standing by setting up a payment method. You will see a red banner across the top of the page with a link to set up a payment method, or you can click the “Set up a payment method” button in the todo list.\n7. Finishing up linkCongratulations! You have successfully created your first event and are ready to go live. You have a basic understanding of how EventPilot works and how to interact with its interface. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please reach out to us at support@geteventpilot.com.\n"

In our eyes, the volunteer experience is one of the most important parts of any event.\nHow to set up for volunteers using EventPilot linkBefore you can start using EventPilot to recruit volunteers, you need to set up your event. This means setting up the locations, jobs, and shifts that your volunteers will work at, as well as building out the registration form so that you are gathering the information you need from your volunteers.\nLocations, Jobs, and Shifts linkThis means creating at least one location for your volunteers to work at, at least one job for your volunteers to spend their time at, and at least one shift for each job you created. Small events may just have one location, job and shift, but larger events will easily cross through 10s of locations and jobs and potentially hundreds of shifts. Registration Form linkBuilding out the registration form is the next step. EventPilot automatically collects the name and email of your volunteers, but it is up to you to decide what else you want to collect. Common things to collect include phone numbers, shirt sizes, “how you heard about us”, if they have volunteered with your event before, and more. The Volunteer Lifecycle linkEventPilot believes that the volunteer experience is one of the most important parts of any event. With EventPilot, the volunteer lifecycle is as easy as:\nRegistration linkYour volunteer uses an easy-to-use form made by EventPilot to register to volunteer for your event.\nConfirmation \u0026 Self-Service linkVolunteer receives an email with all their information and a link to a self-service dashboard where they can manage their registration.\n(This makes volunteers happier because they can change how and when they volunteer to better fit their schedule, and this makes event organizers happier because the volunteer can do this on their own, without having to bug you.)\nReminders linkVolunteer receives an email the week before the event with information about their shift and about the event. This serves as a reminder to volunteers and is an opportunity for event organizers to distribute information about the event.\nDay-of Reminders \u0026 last-minute updates linkVolunteer receives an email the day of the event with information about the event and their shift. This serves as a reference to volunteers and is an opportunity for event organizers to distribute last-minute information about the event.\nCritical event-day updates linkVolunteer receives critical updates sent by organizers during the event via email and SMS (this can include things like weather updates, last-minute changes to the event, and more).\nEvent-day dashboard linkVolunteer has access to a self-service event-day dashboard where they can access information about the event such as FAQ, the schedule, maps, and anything else shared by the organizers. This arms your volunteers with the information they need to feel involved and engaged, and gives them more information about the event that they can pass on to participants, helping your event run more smoothly.\nImmediate thank you linkVolunteer receives an immediate thank you email after they complete their shift.\nFeedback linkVolunteer receives an email after the event with a link to a feedback form where they can share their experience with the organizers.\nRe-Engagement \u0026 follow-up linkVolunteer receives an invitation to volunteer for your event next time it comes around!\n"

When a volunteer registers, they are automatically added to the CRM. When a participant registers, they are automatically added to the CRM. We don’t want to limit you to just using the CRM for people who have interacted with our platform, however, so we allow you to add any other contacts to the CRM. You can add a single contact at a time, or you can import unlimited contacts at once from a CSV file.\nWe wanted to build a powerful CRM that is easy to use and manage. You can add custom fields to your CRM table, allowing you to keep track of the information that matters to you. By default, we have a few fields that we require for contacts (like name), but beyond that, it is pretty much up to you!\nThe EventPilot CRM is also tightly integrated with the interactions that occur between your contacts and EventPilot. Anytime a contact interacts with EventPilot in any way, it will be automatically logged in the CRM. That means that you won’t have anything slip through the cracks.\n"

                content: "Understand how EventPilot organizes the work that needs to be done so your event can run smoothly.\nHow we set it up linkEventPilot is built around the concept of locations, jobs, and shifts.\nShifts live inside of jobs, and jobs live inside of locations.\nLocations linkThink of a location as an independent time and space where volunteers can work. You can have as many locations as you want, and they are a great way to communicate seperate units of work to your volunteers.\nIt is not uncommon to have multiple locations that take place at the same physical location, but may take place at different times. For example, if you are hosting a race of some sort, you might have a few packet pick-up pop-ups in the days leading up to the event. If you event is on Saturday, you might have packet pick-ups on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday at a local coffee shop. Those are all at the same location, but it would make sense to have them as separate locations.\nLocations can be as small and specific as you want. If you are hosting a marathon, you could have a single location for each individual water station if you wanted your volunteers to be able to pick what station they want to work, or you could have a single location and you manage the physical locations yourself.\nIf you have any questions regarding how to set up your event, please contact us at support@geteventpilot.com and we can talk you through it!\nJobs linkThink of a job as a distinct task that needs to be done. For example, if you are hosting a conference, you might have a job for ushers to help attendees find their seats, a job to help speakers get ready for their talk, and a job to help make sure the food table is stocked.\nShifts linkThink of a shift as a time period during which a volunteer is working on a job. Most events last longer than a volunteer would like to work, so it is helpful to allow volunteers to sign up for shorter periods of time.\nThe philosophy behind EventPilot’s organization linkEventPilot is designed for medium- to large-scale events. These events commonly last several days, and span a large geographic area. We want to make it easy for you to manage volunteers across these dimensions, and we want to make it easy for your volunteers to do what they want to do, where they want to do it, and when they want to do it.\n"

                content: "We are constantly working on new features and improvements to EventPilot. Here is a list of what we are working on next.\nTight Email Integration linkEmails are a great opportunity for us to allow our customers to interact with their contacts. Whether that is an automated welcome or thanks for registering email, every email is a touch point and we want to make it easy for you to use EventPilot to tighten your relationships with your contacts.\nEmails are also a great source of data for the CRM, so we want to build a powerful email integration into EventPilot. This means being able to send emails to contacts right from the CRM, and being able to see when the email was delivered and opened right in the timeline with all the other interactions from that contact. We also want to build out an email marketing feature that allows you to send emails to your contacts based on the data living in the CRM.\nGiven all this data, we will be able to build a solid picture of your contacts, their interactions, and their interest in your event, allowing you to target your efforts more effectively.\nEventPilot for Teams linkEventPilot is a great tool for event organizers, but everyone knows everything is more fun with a friend! We want to make it easy for you to invite your team to EventPilot and use it to manage your event alongside your team. No longer will the entire burden land on the shoulders of the event organizer, but instead, you can give your volunteer coordinator the power to manage volunteers, hand the email marketing tools to your marketing/outreach person, and more.\nOrganizations linkWe want to make it easy for you to spin up new events and allow them to inherit the data from your existing events. Many organizations have many events through the year, so we want to give them the same tools present in EventPilot now, but scope them to an organization. This will involve moving the CRM and donations to the organization level.\nDonations linkWe know how important donations are to events and nonprofits, so we want to make it easy for you to accept donations through EventPilot. Centralizing your donations to being on EventPilot will provide you with a powerful tool to help understand the financial picture of your event and your donors.\nUsing the glut of data on your event gathered by EventPilot, you can build out an impactful fundraising campaign that will not only help raise the money for your event to succeed, but raise money for your nonprofit as well.\nParticipant Registration \u0026 Management linkYou can have a great event, but without participants, what is the point? We want to arm event organizers with modern, powerful, and easy-to-use tools to allow participants to register for your event. That means taking the work we have done to build the volunteer registration system and applying it to a participant registration system.\nThis also means integrating with a payments system so that participants can pay for their registration.\nCentralized Support \u0026 Contact Hub linkWe want to allow events to route their support requests to a centralized support hub. That will mean setting up a mailbox that directs to our servers, so that when someone sends an email to support@yourevent.com, it will be routed directly into your EventPilot account, where it gets affiliated and logged with a CRM record, and gives you the ability to respond to the request with all the context of that person’s previous interactions with your event.\nWe can also integrate with social media platforms, so when people send you direct messages, they can filter into the same system, meaning you only have to watch one inbox for all your interactions.\nSocial Media Integration linkGreat events are built on social media, so we want to make it easy for you to integrate your event with your social media accounts. We want to give you the ability to post to all your social media accounts from a single dashboard, manage responses and feedbacks, understand engagement, and see the impact of your social media efforts directly overlaid on your event’s timeline.\n"
