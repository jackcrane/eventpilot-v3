We are constantly working on new features and improvements to EventPilot. Here is a list of what we are working on next.

## Tight Email Integration

Emails are a great opportunity for us to allow our customers to interact with their contacts. Whether that is an automated welcome or thanks for registering email, every email is a touch point and we want to make it easy for you to use EventPilot to tighten your relationships with your contacts.

Emails are also a great source of data for the CRM, so we want to build a powerful email integration into EventPilot. This means being able to send emails to contacts right from the CRM, and being able to see when the email was delivered and opened right in the timeline with all the other interactions from that contact. We also want to build out an email marketing feature that allows you to send emails to your contacts based on the data living in the CRM.

Given all this data, we will be able to build a solid picture of your contacts, their interactions, and their interest in your event, allowing you to target your efforts more effectively.

## EventPilot for Teams

EventPilot is a great tool for event organizers, but everyone knows everything is more fun with a friend! We want to make it easy for you to invite your team to EventPilot and use it to manage your event alongside your team. No longer will the entire burden land on the shoulders of the event organizer, but instead, you can give your volunteer coordinator the power to manage volunteers, hand the email marketing tools to your marketing/outreach person, and more.

## Organizations

We want to make it easy for you to spin up new events and allow them to inherit the data from your existing events. Many organizations have many events through the year, so we want to give them the same tools present in EventPilot now, but scope them to an organization. This will involve moving the CRM and donations to the organization level.

## Donations

We know how important donations are to events and nonprofits, so we want to make it easy for you to accept donations through EventPilot. Centralizing your donations to being on EventPilot will provide you with a powerful tool to help understand the financial picture of your event and your donors.

Using the glut of data on your event gathered by EventPilot, you can build out an impactful fundraising campaign that will not only help raise the money for your event to succeed, but raise money for your nonprofit as well.

## Participant Registration & Management

You can have a great event, but without participants, what is the point? We want to arm event organizers with **modern**, **powerful**, and **easy-to-use** tools to allow participants to register for your event. That means taking the work we have done to build the volunteer registration system and applying it to a participant registration system.

This also means integrating with a payments system so that participants can pay for their registration.

## Centralized Support & Contact Hub

We want to allow events to route their support requests to a centralized support hub. That will mean setting up a mailbox that directs to our servers, so that when someone sends an email to support@yourevent.com, it will be routed directly into your EventPilot account, where it gets affiliated and logged with a CRM record, and gives you the ability to respond to the request with all the context of that person's previous interactions with your event.

We can also integrate with social media platforms, so when people send you direct messages, they can filter into the same system, meaning you only have to watch one inbox for all your interactions.

## Social Media Integration

Great events are built on social media, so we want to make it easy for you to integrate your event with your social media accounts. We want to give you the ability to post to all your social media accounts from a single dashboard, manage responses and feedbacks, understand engagement, and see the impact of your social media efforts directly overlaid on your event's timeline.
